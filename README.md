# Where are the grml-scripts?

Scripts useful in many situations have been moved into [grml-etc-core](https://github.com/grml/grml-etc-core).

Scripts with usefulness mostly on the Live ISOs, have been moved into [grml-live](https://github.com/grml/grml-live/tree/master/config/files).

This repository is now archived. Please file issues either against the correct grml-etc-core or grml-live repositories, or the "grml" repository otherwise.
